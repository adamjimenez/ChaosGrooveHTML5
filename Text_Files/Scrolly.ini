                                                                                            Hello and welcome to Chaos Groove!  Possibly the best game in the world.. ;) This is version 0.9 which while fully playable is missing a few features, options and still contains a few bugs. Chaos Groove is a modern remake of the classic spectrum game Chaos. Chaos Groove attempts to keep the same hugely enjoyable gameplay while offering higher resolution gfx, better sound and a much more modern user interface. Greetings to go out to OddBob, Caffeine Kid, STompy, Hitman and everyone else at Retro Remakes, Mike Welch, Dan 'McGibbage' Marshall, everyone at Allegro.cc, all the people who have commented on and tested the game on my Chaos Groove Development Blog. Chaos Groove contains sound samples used in the Atari ST remake, which were taken from various television shows and movies. In addition new sound samples have been added and better sounds are required really! Some of these sounds are copyrighted, but Chaos Groove is completely free and an advert for great television shows and films, so I hope people understand this.. Some of the sound samples in the Groove sound set do contain swearing, so please be aware of this when playing. Chaos Groove is still in development, but I hope everyone who plays it has a laugh and enjoys the game. Chaos really is one of the best games ever, and I hope new players get into the game through this remake. Thanks for everyone's support! Richard Phipps 2007.
